            Hello and welcome to arch central, this is a one-man blog dedicated to talking about arch, Linux in general, video games, and other tech stuff.
            <br/><br/>
            This blog will be heavily opinionated and I might make a rant or two.
            <br/><br/>
            This blog is fully open-source (both frontend and backend) and you can at anytime go to the blog repo by clicking the button on the top right.
            <br/><br/>
            In terms of design, it is heavily inspired by the news page <a target='_aboutblank' href='https://linuxgamingcentral.com'>linux gaming central</a>
            <br/><br/>
            As of right now, the page is in a beta state, it only has the bare minimum, for more info you can go to the Github page, this is kind of a personal project so don't expect constant updating and new features, you can always feel free to push new features
